WikiEats is a space to create, collaborate, and share memorable food experiences around the world. It was inspired by my love for traveling and sharing delicious meals with new friends along the way. 

Features include the option for users to upgrade to paid accounts, where they have the ability to create private wikis and grant collaborators permission to edit the wikis. In creating wikis, users use markdown to format their stories and upload an image to compliment their experience.

## Motivation <a id="motivation"></a>

WikiEats gave me the opportunity to create another Node.js application with greater freedom. I was given user stories to complete and was able to implement these in any way I saw appropriate. The project was also an opportunity to practice implementing tests without guidance. 

I was excited to work on this project, as I was tasked with building an application from the ground-up and implementing integrations with third-party APIs. I added user stories along the way, including the ability to upload images with wikis. As I added more features, I kept finding ways to better improve the application. It was a slippery slope, and at some point, I had to call it "finished"!

Moving forward, I would like to add the ability for users to tag wikis with keywords. These tags would allow me to create a search function and organize the wikis based on location. I believe this would create a better user experience and allow users to explore and contribute to wikis based on where they've visited.
